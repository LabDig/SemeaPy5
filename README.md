#SemeaPy5
******************************
Open source software developed by seed variable rate application controller.
Developed in Python 3.6 language, and using PyQt5 tools to build the Graphical User Interface(GUI)
******************************
The controller was developed using the BeableBone Black single board computer
The Adafruit BBIO module was used to control GPIO and PWM pin
A Arduino Pro Mini 3.3 V 8 Mhz was used to calculate planter speed and angular velocity of electric motor
******************************
The componentes used was:
BeableBone Black Revision C, with oficial Linux Debian 8.6 operational system
Touch Sensitive 7 inch HDMI LCD Screen
Arduino ProMini 3.3V hMhz
Low Cost GNSS Module Ublox NEO6M
BTS 7690 motor controller
